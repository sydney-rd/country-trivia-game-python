# Country Trivia Game

Welcome to Python Country Trivia! I find geography fascinating. You'll find me studying maps, flags, and capitals, and learning facts about the most obscure countries in our world ðŸŒŽ. 

This quiz contains 5 fill-in questions and 5 multiple choice questions. It's complete with scorekeeping, answer validation, and other features. I hope you learn a cool fact or two while you play!
